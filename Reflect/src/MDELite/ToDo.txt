-- add conformance constraint testing (e.g., see if database tuples are "correct")
    for the remaining prolog databases.  umlf has been completed.

-- change from .umlf.pl to _umlf.pl, to simplify prolog debugging.

-- how can we package libpl and libvm to make it workable outside of Netbeans?

-- it would be GREAT if we could clean the project without invoking bash scripts.
